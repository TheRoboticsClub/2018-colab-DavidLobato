Simple project to build a SPI slave on UP5K platform.

The spi slave reads data bytes sent to it and sets the RGB leds status according to: xxxxxrgb
The included spi_send_command program can send bytes (hex encoded) to the spi slave through USB.
For instance:

$> ./spi_send_command 0x04

will set the red led on.

On current implementation a soft spi core is used rather than the included hardware spi core.
